# Toast Digital Garden Starter

A Digital Garden template built using [Toast](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/toast/).

## Setup

1. Clone and install dependencies. This will also create a `public/web_modules` folder which will include the needed npm modules when shipped up to the cloud.
1. Run `yarn build` / `npm run build` to build the site.
1. Host on a web server. `npx http-server public` will host it on your local machine at `localhost:8080`.
